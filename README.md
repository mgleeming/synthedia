## Introduction
A wide range of software is available to identify and quantify peptides in bottom-up proteomics data acquired by LC-MS/MS and, frequently, analysis of the same input data file with two different packages yields different results. These differences likely originate from differences in algorithms for preprocessing data, matching MSn spectra to peptides, quantifying peak areas, matching assignments between samples as well as differences in the myriad parameters that must be set by the user to initiate an analysis. Thorough analysis of these variables is, however, complicated since the ‘true’ sample composition of real data files is almost never completely known.

Synthedia creates synthetic LC-MS/MS data that mimics real data but with a composition that is exactly known. Currently, synthedia support the creation of Data-Independent Acquisition (DIA) style data wherein fixed, large m/z windows are sequentially isolated for fragmentation. We have focused on creating DIA data to date since the complexity of the analysis preformed by processing tools is substantial and the impact of different acquisition methodologies on the eventual outcome is somewhat more difficult to predict.

Synthedia can be configured to produce synthetic DIA data that mimics a wide range of acquisition strategies. For example, data can be simulated that models the same set of peptides eluted over progressively shorter gradients which would allow an assessment of how processing software copes with increasing complexity of data. Data can be modelled with different mass spectral resolutions, chromatographic peak tailing, DIA window strategies among others. Synthedia can also help to assess quantitation by creating multiple sets of data files which simulate replicates in a multi-group comparison. These modules include abilities to set within and between-group variability as well as simulate missing data in both a random and group-wise manner.

## Getting started

Synthedia can be used by downloading and installing the package or through our web server which can be accessed [here](https://synthedia.org/). Please note that producing synthetic data is a time-consuming task and capacity on our server is limited. In most cases, it will be faster to install synthedia on your own computer as this can take advantage of multiple processing cores.

## Installation

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/mgleeming/synthedia.git
cd synthedia
```
Create a virtual environment (optional):
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Note that the [pyOpenMS](https://pyopenms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) dependency of synthedia requires python 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9. If you have multiple python versions installed, you can construct virtual environments with different versions by:
```
virtualenv venv --python=/path/to/python3.X
```
On linux systems, the path is usually ```/usr/bin/pythonX.X```

Install synthedia:
```
pip install .
```

Synthedia can then be invoked from the command line by:
```
synthedia [COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS]
```

Optionally, you can run the Synthedia integration test to check that everything is working:
```
pip install pytest
pytest -v
```

## Input data types

To create synthetic data, synthedia requires information about peptide fragmentation patterns and some metric as to relative retention time. These can be supplied by either a:
  - [Prosit](https://www.proteomicsdb.org/prosit/)-predicted spectral library
  - MaxQuant 'txt' directory

#### Prosit libraries

[Prosit](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0426-7) is a machine learning-based application that predicts MS/MS fragmentation patterns for input peptide sequences. Input sequences can be arbitrary and do not necessarily need to originate from any specific organism or protein. Prosit will generate an output file that contains predicted abundances for peptide sequence ions.

To create a Synthedia-compatible Prosit spectral library:
  1. Go to https://www.proteomicsdb.org/prosit/
  2. Navigate to 'Spectral Library'
  3. Upload your target peptide list as described in the Prosit documentation
  4. **IMPORTANT**: under the 'Output format' header (just prior to submitting the Prosit task), ensure that **Generic Text** is selected

Once processing is complete, the resulting file can be used with Synthedia

When Prosit inputs are given, Synthedia models peptide precursor abundances using a Gaussian distribution of Log2 instnsities which approximates the disributions typically observed upon anlysis of real data. The parameters of this distribution (mean and standard deviation) can be specified with the ```--prosit_peptide_abundance_mean``` and ```--prosit_peptide_abundance_stdev``` parameters which have defaults of 22 and 3 respectively.


#### MaxQuant 'txt' directories

As an alternative to Prosit, Synthedia can read and simulate DIA data based upon the MaxQuant processing results of a file acquired using a Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) strategy. In this case, peptide fragment ions are generated based on the matched ions for a PSM reported in the MaxQuant ```msms.txt``` file from the ```Masses``` and ```Intensities``` columns. Note: these are only those fragment ions that MaxQuant assigns as matching a given peptide - they may not necessarily provide a 'full' sequence coverage and may not be correctly assigned in some cases.

Synthedia offers options to filter reverse and contaminant peptides as well as filter PSMs by Posterior Error Probability (PEP) values.


## DIA acquisition strategies

DIA-LC-MS/MS data can be acquired in many ways. The default invocation of synthedia creates non-overlapping, 30 Th windows between m/z 350 and m/z 1600. To simulate data using different DIA acquisition strategies, a file defining the acquisition schema can be supplied. An example acquisition schema file and blank template are provided in the ```templates``` directory.

## Decoy signals

LC-MS/MS analysis of bottom-up proteomics samples can be complicated by the presence of ions derived from non-peptide sample contaminants. To mimic this, decoy ions can be simulated together with peptide signals by specifying a decoy database in NIST '.msp' format. See the section 'NIST Text Format of Individual Spectra' in [this document](https://chemdata.nist.gov/mass-spc/ms-search/docs/Ver20Man_11.pdf) for details on the .msp format.

Custom .msp files can be specified or pre-prepared files can be dowloaded from [MS-DIAL](http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/main.html#MSP). The Synthedia web server uses the "All public MS/MS (13,303 unique compounds)" file from [MS-DIAL](http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/main.html#MSP).

The number of decoy peaks to simulate, as well as the maximum number of fragments to simulate per decoy, can be specified throught the command line arguments ```num_decoys``` and ```simulate_top_n_decoy_fragments```.

## Compatibility of Synthedia mzML files with other softeare

The mzML files generated with Synthedia have been tested with:

- DIA-NN
- EncyclopeDIA
- DIAUmppire
- Skyline
- OpenMS/ToppView
- MSConvert

The mzML files are known to not be compatible with MaxQuant (at least as at MaxQuant Version 2.0.3.0)

## Notes about the resulting data

### Peptide vs protein abundances
In a real experiment, all peptides from an up-regulated protein should be observed with increased abundance compared to a control group. Synthedia models ion abundances at the peptide level only. This means that, in the case of a two-group simulation, peptides from the same protein may have very different (even opposing) directions of abundance change between groups. This is primarily because the Prosit input type (which is preferred) does not contain mappings between peptides and input proteins and we wished to maintain the ability to simulated arbitrary peptide data.

As a result of this, if mzML files generated with synthedia are analysed with DIA analysis software, the main comparison in abundances should be made at the peptide level.

### Synthetic vs real data

While we have endeavoured to provide a range of options that allow for simulation of a broad range of chromatographic and mass spectral variables, many experimental processes are not modelled which will cause deviations between simulated and real data. As such, users are warned that simulations with Synthedia do not completely re-create experimental complexity and should be used as an investigational tool only.

As an example, Synthedia offers the capability to simulate the same set of precursors as if acquired on different length chromatographic gradients. This means that data acquired on a lengthy gradients could be reconstructed to approximate acquisition on shorter gradients. In these cases, Synthedia simply models spectra containing signals from many peptides as a simple superposition of their individual signals. In reality however, ion supression effects would result in data that may look substantially different from that which would be produced if a comparable experimental workflow were to be executed.

### Post-translational modifications

Synthedia currently has very limited support for simulating peptides with post-translational modifications. Currently, all cysteine residues are assumed to be modified by carbamidomethylation. No other post-translational modifications are supported.

## Usage

A basic invokation of synthedia using a MaxQuant input directory and accepting all other parameters as default is below:
```
synthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt
```
This will create a directory at the current working directory called 'output' containing the processing results.

Note that the default invocation will produce mzML files with profile peaks at both MS1 and MS2 levels. To create centroided data (which is significantly faster):
```
synthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt --centroid_ms1 --centroid_ms2
```

To create profile MS1 and centroid MS2 data:
```
synthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt --centroid_ms2
```

To plot diagnostic graphics and provide a custom path to an output directory:
```
synthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt --all --out_dir /path/to/out/directory
```

To provide a custom acquisition schema:
```
python synthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt --acquisition_schema /path/to/acquisition_schema.csv
```

To simulate MaxQuant reuslts on a shorter chromatographic gradient:
```
synthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt --new_run_length 10
```

To simulate a two group analysis with three replicates per group:
```
synthedia --mq_txt_dir /path/to/MQ/results/txt --n_groups 2 --samples_per_group 3
```

Rather than specifying arguments on the commmand line, processing parameters can by placed into a ```.yaml``` file and then supplied as:
```
synthedia --config /path/to/params.yaml
```

Assitional or updated parameters can be specified:
```
synthedia --config /path/to/params.yaml  --ms1_resolution 100000
```

In this case the ```ms1_resolution``` parameter value given on the command line is used even if a different value is given in ```/path/to/params.yaml```. That is, the heirarchy is command line parameter > config.yaml > synthedia default.

                            retention time range of the input data will be used.
      --rt_buffer RT_BUFFER
                            Time (in minutes) that should be appended to the
                            beginning and end of the retention time range of a set
                            of input peptides. This helps ensure that peptides at
                            the boundaries of the elution window are simulated
                            completely
      --rt_instability RT_INSTABILITY
                            Introduces an instability in retentention time values
                            for the same peptide when a multi-group or multi-
                            sample simulation is conducted. The value is the
                            maximum number of seconds by which peptide retention
                            times will differ

      --mz_emg_k MZ_EMG_K   Shape factor for exponentially modified gaussian in
                            the mass spectral domain. Must be greater than 0.
                            Increasing K results in more heavily tailed mass
                            spectral peaks. This parameter is inactive unless
                            --mz_peak_model is not set to
                            exponentially_modified_gaussian.
